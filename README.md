## Capstone Idea (Definition Statement)

 I want to build an application that allows hairstylists and barbers to sign up for a service (much like an uber driver) to go mobile and cut people’s hair at home. The application will also allow users to search through the stylist available by location and make appointments/rate the service they received and pay/tip on with the application.

## My Application Will Be Used By (Audience)

- Stylists/Barbers
- People who need a haircut
- People who work from home
- Single parents
- People who work 2 jobs
- Immune compromised people that don’t want to go into public
- People without a car
- Injured people - Broken legs, etc.
- People who don’t have a lot of time to plan ahead for an outside-of-the-house appointment.
- Elderly people
- Parents with several kids
- People who need a last minute haircut
- Hospital visits
- Children with special needs
- Age range: 18 to 65
- Male & Female
- Mentor & Peers
- Recruiters & Career Coaches
- Hiring Managers


## Elevator Pitch

Hi I’m James McMinn, a Savvy Coders student in St. Louis, Missouri. It’s great to meet you!

Since you work with the top investing firm in St. Louis I figured you’d be interested to know that millions of people can't get haircuts for various reasons.

The thing that makes them similar is they simply can't get to the salon or barbershop. 90% of people say they wish there was another way to get a haircut.

The great part about being a Savvy Coder's student is that I've been able to fix their problem with a new Uber-Like app where stylists or barbers will come to your home to cut your hair.

In fact, my app is one of the only apps that offers a service to get your haircut at home on demand.

I think my app could be beneficial to your investment firm as well as myself. Are you available this week to speak further on this?”
