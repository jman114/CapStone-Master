        <h2>Capstone Idea Definition Statement</h2>
        <p>
          I want to build an application that allows hairstylists and barbers to
          sign up for a service (much like an uber driver) to go mobile and cut
          people’s hair at home. The application will also allow users to search
          through the stylist available by location and make appointments/rate
          the service they received and pay/tip on with the application.
        </p>
        <h2>Capstone Elevator Pitch</h2>
        <p>
          Hi I’m James McMinn, a Savvy Coders student in St. Louis, Missouri.
          It’s great to meet you!<br /><br />

          Since you work with the top investing firm in St. Louis I figured
          you’d be interested to know that millions of people can't get haircuts
          for various reasons.<br /><br />

          The thing that makes them similar is they simply can't get to the
          salon or barbershop. 90% of people say they wish there was another way
          to get a haircut.<br /><br />

          The great part about being a Savvy Coder's student is that I've been
          able to fix their problem with a new Uber-Like app where stylists or
          barbers will come to your home to cut your hair.<br /><br />

          In fact, my app is one of the only apps that offers a service to get
          your haircut at home on demand.<br /><br />

          I think my app could be beneficial to your investment firm as well as
          myself. Are you available this week to speak further on this?”
